error[E0277]: the trait bound `u16: From<&str>` is not satisfied
 --> tests/compile_fail/invalid_header.rs:3:10

3 | #[derive(Encode, Debug)]
  |          ^^^^^^ the trait `From<&str>` is not implemented for `u16`
  |
  = help: the following other types implement trait `From<T>`:
            `u16` implements `From<Char>`
            `u16` implements `From<bool>`
            `u16` implements `From<u8>`
  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Encode` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
