# bufferfish-core

Core types, traits, and logic implementations for [bufferfish](https://github.com/robertwayne/bufferfish).

_This project has an unstable API and is missing a variety of functionality. I can't recommend using it in production, although I am using it for my own production project._

## Usage

See the [main project repository](https://github.com/robertwayne/bufferfish) for more details.

## Contributing

Bufferfish is open to contributions, however it should be noted that the library was created for my own game projects, and I am not interested in making it widely general-purpose. If you still have a feature request or bug fix that you think would be useful to others, feel free to open an issue or PR.

## License

Bufferfish source code is dual-licensed under either

- **[MIT License](LICENSE-MIT)**
