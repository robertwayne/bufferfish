error[E0277]: the trait bound `u8: From<&str>` is not satisfied
 --> tests/compile_fail/invalid_header.rs:3:10

3 | #[derive(Encode, Debug)]
  |          ^^^^^^ the trait `From<&str>` is not implemented for `u8`, which is required by `&str: Into<_>`
  |
  = help: the following other types implement trait `From<T>`:
            <u8 as From<Char>>
            <u8 as From<bool>>
  = note: required for `&str` to implement `Into<u8>`
  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Encode` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
